The format of dialogs would be following json format:
\{
    "author": string,
    "text": string,
\}
author - name of actor, who sent the message, your name is {botName}
message - this is what author said

Here are some points to consider, when making decision:
You should always decide to reply if you are mentioned in most recent message(in other words recent message @{botName}). If message is not
directly stated to you, make sure you don't reply too frequently, unless you will find it appropriate. If you feel like your response would provide a valuable
information, or would help someone out, you should decide to respond. Provide your response in following json format:
\{
    "decision": boolean,
    "explanation": string
\}
decision - true, if you decide to reply, false otherwise
explanation - detailed explanation of what caused your decision

Here is most recent message:
{mostRecentMessage}

Here is recent message history, if most recent message didn't provide enough context:
{recentMessageHistory}
