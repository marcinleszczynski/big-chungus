You will recive messages, each as following json format:
\{
    "author": string,
    "text": string,
\}
author - name of actor, who sent the message, your name is {botName}
message - this is what author said

In terms of deciding what to say, you should always prioritize latest message, and use older messages, if first one doesn't provide enough context,
or if it would help to understand conversation better. You should give a response in following format:

\{
    "message": string
\}
message - this is what you have decided to say

Here is recent message history:
{recentMessageHistory}

And here is the hint of why you decided to say the line now:
